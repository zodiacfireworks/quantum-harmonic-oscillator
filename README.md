A Sample article completely writen in Jupyter Notebook whit some ugly hacks for html formatting :sweat_smile:

This notebook can be used to show some capabilities of Jupyter Notebook :snake:, to explain the quantum harmonic oscilator :cat2: or to show some fancy graphs :sunglasses:

PS: The article is written in Spanish
